# Todo-Slack-Bot

Created a shared TODO List application that teams on Slack can install for their users to track and complete their tasks using Slack's slash commands. 

Key Features:-
- The app supports 3 slash commands :- 
  1. /addTodo
  2. /markTodo 
  3. /listTodos. 
- Different channels have different TODO lists. 
- All users in the same channel can see the same TODO list. 
- Responses from the slash commands are visible to everyone in the channel as a message.
